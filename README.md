# ZeerethOS

Welcome to the official repository of ZeerethOS, powered by Universal Blue Bazzite.



## Installation

At First, make sure, that you have bootc. Use the command below to check.
```bash
sudo bootc status
```
If something shows here, about booted image, you have bootc!

### Step 2. Switching OS

Use the command below to switch from your current to Zeereth

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/aaronrblxbbq/zeereth
```
This should queue your image for the next reboot, which you can do immediately after the command finishes.
